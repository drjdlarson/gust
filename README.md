# gust
GCS for UAS Swarming and Teaming (GUST)

# Setup
This requires

- python 3.7
- PyQt5
- PyQt5-tools
- flask
- flask-restx
- requests
- gunicorn

 This should all work in either a virtual environment or a conda environment (everything installed with pip). For freezing (packaging) and creating installer files a custom fork of fbs is required (TODO: setup actual fork and link it here).
